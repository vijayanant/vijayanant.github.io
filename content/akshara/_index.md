constitution:
  - law: "I. Source-Side Secrecy"
    desc: "The hosting infrastructure must be mathematically excluded from the trust boundary. All data is encrypted before transit."
  - law: "II. Content-Addressed Integrity"
    desc: "Validity is a property of the data itself, not the host. Every bit is cryptographically verifiable and location-independent."
  - law: "III. Symmetric Reconciliation"
    desc: "Sovereignty is absolute. Peer convergence is achieved through mathematical mirrors, without central authority."

capabilities:
  - feature: "Topology Independent Infrastructure"
    enabler: "Own Your Infrastructure."
    desc: "Move from Cloud to On-Prem (or P2P) without changing a single line of code."
  - feature: "Merkle-DAG Lineage & Causal Sync"
    enabler: "Audit the History of Truth."
    desc: "Enable legal-grade proof of every edit through a mathematically proven chain of custody."
  - feature: "Content-Addressed Linking"
    enabler: "Build the Linked Web."
    desc: "Enable applications that talk to each other without complex integrations or APIs."
  - feature: "Source-Side Secrecy"
    enabler: "Eliminate Host Risk."
    desc: "Build apps where the host—centralized or distributed—is mathematically blind to your data."
  - feature: "24-Word Deterministic Recovery"
    enabler: "Hardware-Independent Life."
    desc: "Recover your entire digital history from a single phrase. Your life survives even if you lose every device."

use_cases:
  - title: "Medical Collaboration"
    icon: "medical"
    desc: "Securely share Patient Health Information (PHI) between hospitals and specialists. Sovereignty ensures clinical secrecy is maintained even when using commodity hosting or public networks."
  - title: "Legal & Corporate Governance"
    icon: "legal"
    desc: "Maintain absolute privilege for contracts and internal board documents. Causal lineage provides a bit-verifiable audit trail that stands up to the highest technical and legal scrutiny."
  - title: "Mission-Critical Engineering"
    icon: "engineering"
    desc: "Concurrently edit complex designs and codebases across global teams. Akshara ensures that technical intellectual property remains bit-identical, private, and mathematically convergent."
