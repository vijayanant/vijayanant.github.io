## 1. Introduction
This document describes the **Merkle-Index** structure, which provides the mechanism for resolving human-readable path sequences (e.g., `/notes/ideas.txt`) into cryptographically verifiable `Address` objects.

## 2. Structural Definition
A Merkle-Index is a specialized **Data Block** (`0x50`) with the semantic type `"index"`. 

### 2.1 Payload Schema
The encrypted `content` of an index block consists of a **BTreeMap<String, Address>** encoded in DAG-CBOR.
*   **Key:** A UTF-8 string representing a path segment.
*   **Value:** An Akshara `Address` pointing to either a leaf data node or another index node (for nested structures).

## 3. Path Resolution Algorithm
The `GraphWalker` component resolves paths through a recursive lookup process:

1.  **Input:** A `root_id` (BlockId) and a `path` string.
2.  **Normalization:** The path is cleaned of leading/trailing slashes and split into segments.
3.  **Lookup Loop:** For each segment:
    *   Fetch the block identified by the current ID.
    *   Decrypt the content using the project's `GraphKey`.
    *   Locate the segment key in the map.
    *   Update the current ID to the associated `Address`.
4.  **Verification:** At each step, the `Auditor` verifies the integrity of the fetched block.
5.  **Output:** The final `Address` identifying the resource at the end of the path.

## 4. Cycle and Depth Protection
To ensure system stability, the resolution algorithm MUST enforce the following constraints:

*   **Visited Tracking:** The walker MUST maintain a set of all `Address` objects encountered during a single resolution. If an address is repeated, a **Cycle Detected** error must be returned.
*   **Segment Limit:** Resolution MUST be terminated if the number of path segments exceeds **256**.

## 5. Metadata Separation
The Merkle-Index only facilitates **Navigation**. It does not contain authority or ownership information. All social laws are enforced at the **Manifest** layer, which anchors the root of the index tree.
