## 1. Introduction
This document describes the Akshara Storage layer, which defines the interface and operational laws for persisting and retrieving content-addressed bitstreams. 

The storage layer is designed as a **Blind Pipe**. It is responsible for the physical durability of data but remains mathematically excluded from the trust boundary. It serves resources by their Content Identifier (CID) without the capacity to interpret encrypted payloads or verify social authority.

## 2. The Blind Pipe Model
Akshara enforces a strict separation between the "Pure Logic" of the protocol and the "Physical Reality" of the storage medium.

*   **Content Agnosticism:** The storage layer MUST NOT require knowledge of the underlying data schemas or encryption keys to function.
*   **Infrastructure Independence:** The protocol interacts with storage through abstract traits, allowing the same core logic to utilize in-memory maps, local SQLite databases, or distributed cloud-scale SQL clusters.
*   **Asynchronous Foundation:** To support high-concurrency environments like the Akshara Relay, all storage operations MUST be non-blocking and utilize `async/await` patterns.

## 3. Storage Components
The storage layer is defined by three technical components:

1.  **[Interface](interface/):** The formal specification of the `GraphStore` trait and its atomic operations.
2.  **[Semantics](semantics/):** The operational rules for head management, pruning, and data integrity verification at rest.
3.  **[Concurrency](concurrency/):** (Proposed) The specifications for handling high-frequency updates and distributed locking.

## 4. Documentation Structure
*   [**Interface**](interface/): Detailed API specification for `put` and `get` operations.
*   [**Semantics**](semantics/): Rules for manifest head-pruning and resource discovery.
