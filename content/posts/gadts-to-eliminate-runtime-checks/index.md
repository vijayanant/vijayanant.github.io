Type system help programmers ensure that the software they write behave
correctly. They detect errors and also serve as documentation. A good type
system allow abstracting domain specific concepts. Haskell’s much appreciated
ADTs though powerful, is still lacking in few aspects. GADTs fill that gap.

This article explains GADTs with simple examples.

Generalised Algebraic Data Types (GADTs) generalises ordinary Algebraic Data
Types(ADTs) by permitting value constructors to return specific types. GADTs
are used for ensuring program correctness and in generic programming. This
article is specific to Haskell programming language. In Haskell GADTs are
implemented as a language extension. The article describes these use cases
with small programs.

## Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)

ADTs are composite types, i.e., types formed by combining other types.
Depending on how the types are combined, we can have either a _sum_ type or a
_product_ type.

```haskell
data Point = Pt Int Int
data Expr a = Number Integer | Boolean Bool
```

In the example above `Point` and `Expr` are called _type constructors_ and
`Pt`, `Number`, and `Boolean` are called _value constructors_. If a type has
more than one value constructor, they are called alternatives: one can use any
of these alternatives to create a value of that type.

```haskell
ghci> let a = Number 10
ghci> let b = Boolean True

ghci> :t a
a :: Expr

ghci> :t b
b :: Expr
```

Notice that the type of both `a` and `b` is `Expr.` This is because of the
type of the value constructors.

```haskell
ghci> :t Number
Number :: Integer -> Expr

ghci> :t Boolean
Boolean :: Bool -> Expr
```

To showcase how this complicates code, let us extend our type a bit and also
add a expression evaluator.

```haskell
data Expr = Number Int
          | Succ Expr
          | IsZero Expr
          | If Expr Expr Expr

data Value = IntVal Int | BoolVal Bool

eval :: Expr -> Value
eval (Number i) = IntVal i
eval (Succ e) = case eval e of
        IntVal i -> IntVal (i+1)
eval (IsZero e) = case eval e of
        IntVal i -> BoolVal (i==0)
eval (If b e1 e2) = case eval b of
        BoolVal True  -> eval e1
        BoolVal False -> eval e2
```

If you notice carefully, this allows for some invalid expressions to type
check successfully.

```haskell
expr1 = Succ (Number 1)          -- valid and type checks
expr2 = Succ (IsZero (Number 1)) -- invalid but type checks
```

Also, notice how our `eval` function is _partially_ implemented. We do not
know what to evaluate a expression `Succ (IsZero (Number 1))` to. We could
allow the function to indicate error by using a `Maybe` or `Either` type, but
that complicates the `eval` function further as we recursively call `eval`.
Try it out for fun.

## Generalised ADTs

The idea behind GADTs is to allow arbitrary return types for value
constructors. They _generalize_ ordinary data types. GADTs are provided in GHC
as a language extension. We can enable this feature using the `LANGUAGE`
pragma. It provides a new syntax for defining data types. We specify type for
each value constructor. We can now redefine our `Expr` type like below:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}

data Expr a where
  Number :: Int -> Expr Int
  Succ   :: Expr Int -> Expr Int
  IsZero :: Expr Int -> Expr Bool
  If     :: Expr Bool -> Expr a -> Expr a -> Expr a
```

Notice that return type for value constructor can differ. This allows our
program to be more strict. The value constructor `Succ`, for example, expects
a `Expr Int.` The compiler can now reject code if you provide `Expr Bool` or
anything else.

```haskell
ghci> :t Succ (Number 10)
Succ (Number 10) :: Expr Int

ghci> :t Succ (IsZero (Number 0))
<interactive>:1:7: error:
     Couldn’t match type Bool with Int
      Expected type: Expr Int
        Actual type: Expr Bool
     In the first argument of Succ, namely (IsZero (Number 0))
      In the expression: Succ (IsZero (Number 0))
```

Now, with the refined `Expr` type, the evaluation of expression become simple.
The expression evaluator need not worry about cases where the type do not
match (ill-typed expression we saw earlier). The new evaluator is easy to
write and read.

```haskell
eval :: Expr a -> a
eval (Number i) = i
eval (Succ e) = 1 + eval e
eval (IsZero e) = 0 == eval e
eval (If b e1 e2) = if eval b then eval e1 else eval e2
```

This version of `eval` is complete unlike the previously implemented one. If
we are evaluating an expression, the expression is guaranteed to be valid and
no failure cases are possible. Compile time guarantee is always better than a
runtime check.
