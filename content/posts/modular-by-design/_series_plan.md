# Narrative Plan for the "Modular by Design: Crafting Evolvable Architectures" Series

## Definition: Modular by Design

"Modular by Design" is an architectural philosophy and practice where a software system is intentionally structured as a collection of loosely coupled, highly cohesive modules. This deliberate decomposition is driven by the strategic goal of managing complexity, enabling independent evolution, enhancing maintainability, and fostering adaptability in the face of continuous change. It is the conscious act of crafting a system's boundaries to ensure its long-term health and resilience.

## Authorial Directives for Each Post

This series is a guided curriculum with a clear philosophy. The following directives outline the author's intent for each post, ensuring it contributes to the overarching goal of understanding and achieving "Modular by Design."

1.  **Achieving Modularity:**
    *   **Directive:** Explicitly define "Modular by Design" as the strategic goal of the series. Introduce Information Hiding as the foundational technique for achieving this by making deliberate predictions about change, thereby laying the groundwork for a system that is "Modular by Design."

2.  **Good Coupling, Bad Coupling, and Cohesion:**
    *   **Directive:** Present coupling and cohesion as the essential metrics for evaluating the quality of module boundaries created through Information Hiding. Emphasize that the goal is *managed dependency*, not isolation, and that these metrics are crucial for building systems that are truly "Modular by Design."

3.  **Modularity Through The Ages:**
    *   **Directive:** Frame architectural evolution (RPCs, SOA, Microservices) as a continuous, often iterative, attempt to solve the timeless problems of modularity, coupling, and cohesion. Show how the tools change, but the underlying principles remain the driving force behind design decisions that lead to systems that are "Modular by Design."

4.  **Looking Back At RPCs:**
    *   **Directive:** Analyze RPC as a specific architectural choice driven by modularity concerns (e.g., transparency, distribution). Explicitly demonstrate how its "procedural abstraction" impacts coupling, cohesion, and information hiding, and how these impacts affect the system's ability to be "Modular by Design."

5.  **Think Entity, Not Procedures:**
    *   **Directive:** Analyze REST as a contrasting architectural choice, driven by different modularity concerns (e.g., evolvability, independent deployment). Explicitly demonstrate how its "entity abstraction" impacts coupling, cohesion, and information hiding, and how these impacts contribute to (or detract from) a system being "Modular by Design." Frame the discussion of HATEOAS and pragmatism as a reminder to return to first principles of modularity.

This document outlines the narrative flow for the series, ensuring each post connects to the next, creating a cohesive learning path for the reader.

### 1. Achieving Modularity

*   **Focus:** Teaches the "how-to" of modularity using Information Hiding as a practical technique.
*   **New Conclusion:** Will end by saying, "Now that we have a technique for creating module boundaries, how do we measure the quality of those boundaries? In our next post, we'll explore coupling and cohesion, the key metrics for a well-designed module."

---

### 2. Good Coupling, Bad Coupling, and Cohesion

*   **New Introduction:** Will start with, "In the previous post, we learned how to use Information Hiding to define our modules. Now, we'll learn how to evaluate that design using the critical concepts of coupling and cohesion."
*   **New Conclusion:** Will transition by saying, "This timeless push and pull between coupling and cohesion isn't new. To understand its impact, let's take a journey through the history of software architecture to see how this struggle has shaped our industry."

---

### 3. Modularity Through The Ages

*   **New Introduction:** Will begin, "We've established the core principles of modular design. Now, let's put them in context by exploring how the pursuit of modularity has been a constant, driving force throughout the history of software architecture."
*   **New Conclusion:** Will set up the case studies: "This history shows that while technologies change, the principles are timeless. To see this in action, our next post will dive deep into a classic architectural style, Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), and analyze it through the lens of modularity."

---

### 4. Looking Back At RPCs

*   **New Introduction:** Will say, "Having traced the history of modularity, let's apply our principles to our first major case study: Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), an approach that tries to make distributed systems feel seamless."
*   **New Conclusion:** Will create a contrast: "RPCs offer a powerful procedural abstraction, but they come with their own coupling challenges. Is there a different way? In our final post, we'll explore a contrasting philosophy: REST, which asks us to think about 'entities' instead of 'procedures'."

---

### 5. Think Entity, Not Procedures

*   **New Introduction:** Will start, "In our last post, we analyzed the procedural world of RPCs. We'll now conclude our series by exploring a fundamentally different architectural style: REST, and see how its entity-based approach offers another path to modularity."
*   **New Conclusion:** This will be the grand finale for the series, summarizing the entire journey from the 'how-to' of information hiding to the high-level architectural trade-offs, tying everything back to the core theme of being "Modular by Design."
