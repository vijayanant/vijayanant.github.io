In the previous post, we analyzed the world of Remote Procedure Calls, an architectural style built on a powerful **procedural abstraction**. This philosophy of modeling the world as a set of actions has a long and rich history, from OOP counterparts like [CORBA](http://corba.org), Microsoft’s [DCOM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dcom/4a893f3d-bd29-48cd-9f43-d9777a4415b0), and [Java RMI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/index.html), to modern reincarnations like Google’s **[gRPC](https://grpc.io/)** and **[Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/)**.

Now, in the final chapter of our "Modular by Design" series, we will explore a fundamentally different philosophy: Representational State Transfer (REST). We will see how its **entity abstraction** offers another path to modularity and discover how the way we choose to model the world is one of the most critical architectural decisions we can make.

All these frameworks follow the familiar client/server architecture in which a
client invokes a procedure that executes on the server. Arguments can be
passed from the client to the server and return values can be passed from the
server to the client.

## Birth Of WebServices

It is hard to say at what point RPCs became Web services as it is an
evolutionary tale as there were many technologies between the first RPC and
modern WebServices.

[XML-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC) is where we start to de-
couple the client from the server. In XML-RPC, payloads are XML (text, as
opposed to binary) and commonly use HTTP rather than a proprietary system. To
support XML-RPC, a programming language requires only a standard HTTP library
and libraries to process XML. [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) is an
XML dialect derived from XML-RPC and is considerably heavier as it tries to
[standardise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_service_specifications)
many of the stuff between the client and the server. By relying on XML and
HTTP, the client and the server need not be coded in the same language or even
in the same style of language.

## Evolve Independently And Incrementally

Imagine collaborating organisations or even different departments within a
large organisation. They all share data and services. Even though there is
collaboration, they all largely develop and deploy software on their own
terms, at their own pace, and they all use different tech stacks. The
challenge lies in enabling this exchange while allowing each entity to evolve
independently.

Updating features or data on one side can cause ripple effects, forcing the
other side to adapt as well. Clients, which may themselves be services, need
to keep working despite of all the changes on the server side. This tight
coupling makes independent evolution a complex and potentially disruptive
process.

## WWW Approach To APIs

The success of the world-wide-web has led to an alternative model for APIs —
**Representational State Transfer** (ReST). ReST embodies the design
principles that underpin HTTP and the world-wide-web itself.

{{< figure src="think-entity-not-procedures-2.png" alt="Diagram illustrating the World Wide Web (WWW) approach to APIs, showing a client interacting with a server via HTTP." caption="The WWW approach: a client interacts with a server using the standardized HTTP API." >}}

The ReST model is the perfect inverse of the RPC model. In the RPC model, the
addressable units are procedures, and the entities of the problem domain are
hidden behind the procedures. In the ReST model, the addressable units are the
entities themselves and the behaviours of the system are hidden behind the
entities as side-effects of creating, updating, or deleting them.

{{< figure src="think-entity-not-procedures-3.png" >}}

## One API To Rule Them All

A prominent feature that made WWW a success is the fact that every site on the
WWW exposes exactly the same API - the HTTP. The web browsers only need to
know a single API to navigate the entire web.

{{< note type="info" title="REST and Modularity" >}}
The power of REST, particularly its reliance on HTTP's generic interface, lies in its ability to foster extreme loose coupling. Unlike RPC, where clients often need specific knowledge of remote procedures, a REST client primarily interacts with generic resources via standardized verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). This means the client is less coupled to the server's internal implementation details, allowing both client and server to evolve more independently—a direct application of the loose coupling and information hiding principles we've discussed.
{{< /note >}}

Since HTTP is already so widely known, there’s a lot less to learn about a new
API that uses ReST. Compare this to RPC - every new API has to be learnt
fresh. Learning an RPC API is very similar to learning a new programming
library. The interface of a library is typically made up of many procedures
and the signatures of each have to be learned. There’s also little commonality
or predictability between procedures in different libraries.

## Beyond the Database Analogy

The database analogy, common in introductory materials, treats learning REST
APIs like learning a database schema. Both involve well-defined structures
accessed through unique identifiers (URLs in REST). However, the analogy
breaks down when considering internal details. Clients shouldn't be concerned
with resource structure or underlying data models – these are implementation
details.

You wouldn’t expose your table names to clients, would you? You shouldn’t
force your clients on your resource names, its structure, or its location.
They are internal details. Why would the client know what fields are in your
tables?

DB Analogy is particularly bad as it gives a false idea that ‘resources’ are
the same as the internal data model. They are not the same. Moving beyond the
analogy, let's explore the true nature of resources and their relationship to
entities within a ReSTful API.

{{< quote type="pull" >}}
… resources are just consistent mappings from an identifier to some set of
views on server-side state. If one view doesn’t suit your needs, then feel
free to create a different resource that provides a better view (for any
definition of “better”). These views need not have anything to do with how the
information is stored on the server, or even what kind of state it ultimately
reflects. It just needs to be understandable (and actionable) by the
recipient.

## ReST And Loose Coupling

In a system where [clients are de-coupled from the server]({{< ref "posts/modular-by-design/good-coupling-bad-coupling-and-cohesion" >}}), clients will in general be fault tolerant and thus robust. In such
a system changes done on the server will not affect the client as they adapt
to the changes; while a tightly coupled client will fail to process further
requests. We should know that for any two systems to be completely de-coupled
they must not communicate with each other at all! The goal is to minimise the
dependency as much as possible.

In a SOAP API, for example, the tight coupling is defined via the WSDL
contract which defines the server endpoint and the operations available to
invoke as well as the parameter needed and response types to expect. If the
server is adding or (re)moving certain parameters, that client will fail to
send further requests and hence needs to be updated before it can continue to
work.

{{< quote type="pull" >}}
In a loosely coupled system, both the client and the server should be able to
evolve independently of the other.
{{< /quote >}}

ReST achieves this by using two key mechanisms: **hypermedia** responses and
standardised **media types**. Through hypermedia responses, the server
**controls the application flow** by providing links within the response that
guides the client to related resources and available actions. Think of these
links as helpful hints from the server, guiding the client on what actions it
can take. These links eliminate the need for the client to have pre-programmed
knowledge of the entire API structure.

    width=700
>}}

Standardised media types, on the other hand, help with **interpreting the data
being exchanged**. They define the format, structure, and semantics of the
data, ensuring both client and server understand the information being sent
and received. This allows for independent evolution as changes to the data
representation on the server can be communicated through the media type
itself, without requiring modifications to the client's understanding of the
data format.

{{< quote type="pull" >}}
If our ReST system (or just the client) fails because the server changed
something, then are we really building ReST systems? Does the browser fail
because the server changed something?
{{< /quote >}}

This hypermedia-driven state transition **allows server and client to evolve
independently**. The server dictates the valid state transitions by providing
hypermedia links within responses. These links tell the client what actions
are available for a specific resource and how to perform them. While the
server controls the state transitions through links, the client still has the
freedom to choose which links to follow. This allows for flexibility and
exploration within the application boundaries defined by the server.

There is still some dependency - the initial URI and media types. Not
everything can be standardised as a media type; domain-specific media types
are very much needed. However, there are still ways to work with them through
media-type versioning and [Code-On-
Demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_on_demand) mechanisms.

{{< quote type="pull" >}}
If the client thinks it knows the URIs beforehand (other than the initial URI)
due to a contract, or the URL structure, or something else, you're not in
hypermedia, you're into the modern day JSON based soap model.

## **HATEOAS Is Not Common**

Roy Fielding emphasises that adhering to core REST principles, including
HATEOAS (**H** ypermedia **A** s **T** he **E** ngine **O** f **A** pplication
**S** tate), is crucial for building true RESTful APIs. Simply using HTTP
methods and URLs doesn't guarantee a RESTful system.

{{< quote type="pull" >}}
if the engine of application state (and hence the API) is not being driven by
hypertext, then it cannot be RESTful and cannot be a REST API. Period.

— Roy T. Fielding
{{< /quote >}}

However, it is important to acknowledge a practical reality: While a powerful
concept, HATEOAS is not as widely implemented in real-world RESTful APIs as
one might expect. Most developers steer away from this claiming pragmatism. If
you are building and exposing APIs to consumers outside your organisation,
forget about following HATEOAS; none of your clients will be following HATEOAS
and no will use your API.

{{< quote type="pull" >}}
For an API to be ReSTful, i.e., HATEOAS compliant, the client also needs to be
HATEOAS compliant!
{{< /quote >}}

While pragmatic considerations often lead to omitting HATEOAS in favour of
pre-defined API structures and request-response structures, it's important to
be aware of the potential consequences. Skipping HATEOAS lead to tighter
coupling between clients and servers, where clients become reliant on specific
resource URLs and functionalities. This tight coupling can hinder independent
evolution and bears some resemblance to the limitations we saw with RPC-style
architectures.

{{< summary title="Key Takeaways from REST" >}}
*   **Entity Abstraction:** REST models the world as resources (entities) rather than procedures, promoting a different architectural worldview.
*   **Loose Coupling via Generic Interface:** HTTP's standardized verbs and uniform interface enable extreme loose coupling, allowing clients and servers to evolve independently.
*   **HATEOAS for Evolvable APIs:** Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS) is a core REST principle that allows servers to guide clients through available actions, further reducing coupling.
*   **Pragmatism vs. Purity:** While adhering to all REST constraints (like HATEOAS) is ideal, practical considerations often lead to compromises. Understanding the principles helps make informed trade-offs.
{{< /summary >}}

It is much harder to build REST system. It is OK to build non-rest systems if
it helps in any way. It is just a matter of knowing what is and is not REST.
It is okay to prioritise practicality in certain situations. Understanding
REST principles helps you make informed decisions. A well-designed API - even
if it doesn’t adhere to all the ReST constraints- can still be efficient and
maintainable.

Our journey is now complete. From the foundational technique of Information Hiding, to the critical metrics of coupling and cohesion, to the long arc of history, and finally, to the competing worldviews of RPC and REST—it all comes back to a single pursuit. Being "Modular by Design" is not about following a dogma, but about consciously and deliberately making the trade-offs that allow our systems to grow and adapt. It is the timeless, essential work of the software architect.
