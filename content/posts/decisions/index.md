We all make decisions. We should make decisions to be happy.

To go to college, to drop out, to get a job, to freelance, to take over family
business, to start your own, to take a break from your job, to get married, to
visit friends, to avoid talking to some, to go shopping, to buy online, to go
jogging, to sleep more, to make peace, to go to war. All decisions are made to
be happy.

Some times you end up less happy. Don’t fret! All you need is to make another
decision. A better one using all the knowledge you gained in previous
decisions.

It is not that hard.
