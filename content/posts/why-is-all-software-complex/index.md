What makes modern software complex?

  * Delivering Fast 

  * Padding Up Resumes

  * Want to use Latest Tech

  * More money in New Tech

  * Learning new Tech is More important

Individually, none of these have any significant impact. What is important
though, is Engineers, including CTOs quite often, are more interested in these
than working towards building “simple systems”.
