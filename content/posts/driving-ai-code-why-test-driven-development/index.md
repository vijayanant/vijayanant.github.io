## The Double-Edged Sword of LLM Code Generation

Alright, let's be real for a moment. If you're involved in tech, it's next to
impossible to ignore Large Language Models (LLMs) these days. They've evolved
from experimental curiosities into **powerful, everyday tools** that are
fundamentally changing how we approach coding. This isn't theoretical; it's
just how we do things now, offering a significant "superpower" to developers.

{{< figure src="driving-ai-code-why-test-driven-development-1.jpeg" alt="Driving AI Code: Why Test-Driven Development is Essential in the LLM Era" width=600 >}}

The biggest thing LLMs do for us is **AI-powered code generation**. Tools like
[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) (an AI pair programmer
for autocompletion and suggestions), [Google Gemini Code
Assist](https://codeassist.google/) (Google's AI coding assistant), [Amazon Q
Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) (which evolved from
CodeWhisperer, offering conversational AI for developers), Sourcegraph Cody
(known for its deep IDE integration and chat features), and
[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) (an AI-native IDE built around LLMs) are no
longer novelties. We're actively using them for quick boilerplate generation,
efficient function and module drafting, and providing smart**** autocompletion
right in our IDEs. On top of that, conversational LLMs such as
[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/overview/) (OpenAI's conversational AI)
and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) (Google's conversational AI) have
become go-to assistants for debugging help, explaining errors, and even
generating documentation and comments. All this means one thing: **huge speed
and efficiency gains**. We can get routine tasks done way faster, and
prototype at a pace we couldn't imagine before.

### The Core Problem: The "Dump" Phenomenon and Eroding Understanding

Okay, so LLMs are super fast. Here’s the catch, one we often don’t notice
until it’s too late: they tend to **"dump" big, complete code chunks** when
you give them a broad prompt. Looks productive, right? But it skips something
crucial: the **human process of incremental design derivation**.

When we build something step-by-step, we're not just writing code, we're
actually _designing_ it. We're breaking down problems, making conscious
architectural choices, and solving small pieces incrementally. This builds our
**deep understanding** of how the solution works inside, its structure, and
why it's built that way. When an LLM just dumps code, we miss that crucial
journey. We get the "what," but often lose the "why" and "how" of its internal
design. That's the **anti-pattern** we're talking about.

{{< figure src="driving-ai-code-why-test-driven-development-2.png" alt="Driving AI Code: Why Test-Driven Development is Essential in the LLM Era" width=600 >}}

This brings us to the main question for this essay: How do we use LLMs'
amazing speed without giving up on that fundamental understanding and design
integrity?

### The Implicit Question: New Power, New Responsibilities?

The allure of accelerated development with LLMs is undeniable. One might be
tempted to simply "prompt and integrate," riding the wave of newfound
productivity.

However, any significant technological power, especially one as transformative
as generative AI, inherently introduces a new set of responsibilities and
subtle challenges. It's not merely about speed; it's about what that speed
might inadvertently compromise if not approached with caution. We must
consider the potential trade-offs in areas such as **code quality** , **long-
term maintainability** , and the overall **reliability** of the software we
are building. The landscape is shifting rapidly, prompting a critical
question: how do our existing, proven software engineering disciplines adapt
in this new era? Does the convenience of generated code inadvertently create
new blind spots or introduce unforeseen complexities down the line? This is
not to diminish the potential of LLMs, but rather to acknowledge that
harnessing it responsibly requires a critical re-evaluation of our approach.

{{< quote type="pull">}}
Any new power, especially one as transformative and inherently complex as
generative AI, doesn't arrive without its own set of nuanced challenges.
{{< /quote >}}

**Test-Driven Development** (TDD), through its disciplined, test-first
approach, directly **counters the "dumping"** behaviour of LLMs by forcing
incremental **design evolution** and fostering deep **developer
understanding** , leading to higher quality, more maintainable, and adaptable
code that LLMs alone cannot provide.

As you consider this ‘heavy’ claim, you might immediately be asking yourself:

* "Why should I, the developer, need to deeply understand the design? Can't I just ask the AI to 'fix' any bugs by giving it a detailed description, and avoid slowing down during development?"

* "Instead of building my own understanding, why can't I just provide the entire codebase to the AI and ask it questions to grasp its design, logic, and intricacies?"

* "If automated documentation is an LLM 'superpower,' isn't asking the AI to generate documentation a better alternative to building understanding through coding, and won't that save significant time?"

These are valid questions, reflecting common assumptions about LLM
integration. But, as we'll see, the answers here point to deeper problems and
pitfalls than just how easy it seems right away.

## The Technical Deficiencies of Un-Guided, LLM-Dumped Code

Okay, we've seen how LLMs offer a real superpower. But there's a flip side. In
this part, we'll explore the **technical risks** that arise when LLMs generate
code without careful guidance.

### Opaque Logic: Hallucinations, Subtle Bugs, and the "Why"

We've talked about the "dump" phenomenon – that tendency for LLMs to spit out
big, complete code chunks from broad prompts. It looks like progress, right?
But this approach often hides a critical flaw: the code can be a **black
box**. You see it, but you don't really get _why_ it was generated that way,
or the actual logic the LLM followed. This isn't just theory; it directly
hurts our software's quality and reliability.

{{< figure src="driving-ai-code-why-test-driven-development-3.png" alt="Driving AI Code: Why Test-Driven Development is Essential in the LLM Era" width=600 >}}

The trickiest issue here is **hallucinations** , a known problem with LLMs, as
detailed by [research by Arjun Krishna et al.
(2025)](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19012v1). They guess the next most likely
word or code token **based on patterns, not true understanding or reasoning**.
Sometimes, this guess gives you code that looks perfectly fine but is
logically wrong, doesn't actually work, or even uses APIs that don't exist.
They might make up a function call or misuse a library in a way that _seems_
okay but quietly breaks your code.

{{< quote type="pull">}}
When an AI "dumps" a solution, these quiet logical flaws are way harder to
spot. We're left debugging code where we don't understand its design, which
makes it a nightmare to fix.
{{< /quote >}}

It's not just a bug; it's a bug in something alien, and trying to find the
"why" becomes a long, frustrating headache.

### Hidden Security Debts: Vulnerabilities from Un-Derived Design

Beyond logic errors and hallucinations, there's an even bigger problem when
you just accept "dumped" code: **hidden security debts**. This isn't about
obvious mistakes; it's about subtle vulnerabilities that sneak into your code
because you, the human, didn't actively design it to prevent them. When an LLM
generates code, it usually just focuses on making it functional. It doesn't
think about security like a human architect would, especially when things get
complex.

{{< figure src="driving-ai-code-why-test-driven-development-4.jpg" alt="Driving AI Code: Why Test-Driven Development is Essential in the LLM Era" width=600 >}}

Security pros have widely shown that LLMs, through well-known attack vectors
like "**prompt injection** ," can be tricked into generating insecure
patterns, or how their training data accidentally picks up flawed or
vulnerable code snippets that get copied, a concern highlighted in [research
by Kharma et. al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.01853v1). Spotting these
issues in a big, pre-generated code block is incredibly tough. Without that
iterative, test-driven process where you intentionally think about security at
each small design step, these vulnerabilities become hidden landmines. They
create a huge security debt that's expensive and dangerous to fix later. It's
not just about making the code work; it's about building secure systems from
the ground up, and that needs a human eye on every piece of logic as it's laid
down.

### The Maintenance Trap: The High Cost of Opaque Code

One of the biggest and most sneaky problems with relying on LLM-dumped code is
that it always leads to more and more **maintenance work and complexity**. For
experienced developers, this isn't just "bad code"; it's getting stuck with
code where the crucial aspects such as _why_ it is structured that way, how it
works, and what it assumes, are mostly missing from human understanding. This
lack of **design ownership and clarity** directly jacks up the cost of
changing software.

{{< quote type="pull">}}
We have seen codebases, even one just a couple of years old, are called
"legacy" and "untouchable" if the developers don’t understand the code.
{{< /quote >}}

Developers, everywhere, just hesitate to touch opaque code. The LLM "dump"
phenomenon only **makes this existing problem worse** , speeding up how fast
code turns from an asset into a liability.

{{< figure
    src="driving-ai-code-why-test-driven-development-5.png"
    alt="Driving AI Code: Why Test-Driven Development is Essential in the LLM Era"
    width=600
>}}

Future changes, bug fixes, performance boosts, or new features become a
nightmare. Instead of extending a clear, well-understood system, you get stuck
wrestling with a black box. Every change turns into a risky, time-consuming
archaeological dig, trying to figure out the design that was never truly
human-designed. This creates brittle code, a big reluctance to refactor, and
eventually, a codebase that costs more and more to change and update. The
initial "speed gain" from the LLM dump is quickly lost to huge, often unseen,
long-term costs. It also kills a team's confidence in being able to update and
maintain the software. It's like taking over a complex, undocumented machine –
you can press the buttons, but you truly don't know how to fix it when it
breaks or make it do something new efficiently.

{{< quote type="pull" >}}
Sometimes developers call these outcomes – more maintenance work, complex
changes, and less clarity – **"technical debt."** But most see it
differently. True [technical debt often comes from a calculated choice]({{< ref "posts/bad-code-is-not-tech-debt" >}}) to deliver fast, knowing you'll fix
things later. The problems with LLM-dumped code, though, are usually an
_unintended side effect_ of not having a clear design process. It makes the
code a black box where the "why" was never consciously built in. This burden
is more like a surprise liability than a planned debt.
{{< /quote >}}

### Non-Determinism vs. Deterministic Control

Software development is, at its core, all about **determinism**. When we write
code, we expect the same input to always give us the same output, and our
tests to reliably pass or fail every time. This predictability is key to
building solid systems. But here's the thing: Large Language Models inherently
mess with this.

LLMs are **probabilistic**. Their outputs are based on probabilities, meaning
the same prompt can produce slightly different versions of code, even with
identical input, a characteristic of their probabilistic nature ([Neptune.ai,
2024](https://neptune.ai/blog/llm-hallucinations)). This non-deterministic
behaviour creates a quiet but big problem in development. When using LLM-
dumped code, you might get a working solution one minute, then a subtly
different, maybe broken, version next. This makes traditional testing
trickier. Simply re-running tests against a new LLM generation doesn't
guarantee the same logic or assumptions are maintained. Without a human-driven
process to clearly define how things should work through small, specific
tests, the LLM's unpredictable nature can kill confidence in the code. It
makes it harder to understand, debug, and ultimately trust. It pushes the job
of making things predictable from the coder to the person checking the code,
often after it's already built.

### Overreliance and the Erosion of Developer Understanding

LLMs' amazing efficiency comes with a silent, but big, risk: **overreliance**
, as explored in [academic work by Jošt
(2024)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380583693_The_Impact_of_Large_Language_Models_on_Programming_Education_and_Student_Learning_Outcomes).
When a powerful AI can quickly spit out huge code sections, it's super
tempting for developers to just accept the output, maybe glance at it, and
move on. This "prompt and integrate" mindset, while it seems fast, really eats
away at your deep understanding of the code you're building.

This isn't just about being lazy; it's a system-wide problem. If you're not
actively involved in tiny design decisions, breaking down problems, and
understanding the "why" behind each piece of logic, you're basically giving up
control over how the code works.

{{< quote type="pull">}}
If you're not actively involved in tiny design decisions... you're basically
giving up control over how the code works.
{{< /quote >}}

When the LLM "dumps" a solution, you become a checker of outside code instead
of a designer or engineer. Over time, this lessens your understanding of the
system's complexities, how its parts connect, and the small trade-offs made
during building. This loss of understanding messes with everything: effective
debugging, confident refactoring, and smart future planning. Without that
internal mental map built by actively participating in design, you just manage
code you don't truly get, leaving you unprepared for tough, unexpected
problems LLMs can't handle yet.

{{< figure src="driving-ai-code-why-test-driven-development-6.png" alt="Driving AI Code: Why Test-Driven Development is Essential in the LLM Era" width=600 >}}

This passive acceptance, caused by LLMs "dumping" full solutions, actually
stops you from getting that deep understanding. It creates a quiet but big
contradiction: LLMs promise efficiency, but just going along with their output
can actually make you less effective at using them well. The skill to write
precise, guiding prompts – to break complex problems into small, AI-friendly
pieces – becomes key to being a good developer.

{{< quote type="pull">}}
If you don't really understand the code's evolving design, you won't even know
_what to ask_ the AI, let alone how to check its big, dumped answers.
{{< /quote >}}

So, the fake speed of the LLM "dump" pattern actively works against building
the very skills you need for real, long-term AI-assisted productivity.

### Contextual Limitations

Beyond the immediate quality and how easy it is to understand LLM-generated
code, one other big worry that pushes home why we need human oversight and
good design practices is LLMs' inherent **contextual limitations** , a
technical aspect [well-explained by Google
Cloud.](<https://cloud.google.com/transform/the-prompt-what-are-long-context->
windows-and-why-do-they-matter).

{{< figure src="driving-ai-code-why-test-driven-development-7.png" alt="Driving AI Code: Why Test-Driven Development is Essential in the LLM Era" width=600 >}}

Even though LLMs are super powerful, they only work within a limited **context
window** due to the computational demands of their architecture (like the
attention mechanism). They're great at generating code based on your immediate
prompt and a small bit of surrounding code (like a few hundred lines in your
IDE). But real-world enterprise codebases – thousands or millions of lines,
complex architectures, deep domain-specific logic – are way bigger than any
LLM's current context window can handle. This means LLMs struggle to make code
that truly fits into a big, existing system, or to correctly understand and
use complex internal APIs without a human constantly guiding them. The code
they "dump" for a big task will often be generic, missing project-specific
design choices or existing parts, so you'll have to do a lot of human
refactoring and integration anyway.

### Intellectual Property (IP) and Copyright Concerns

Before we dive into this, a quick meta-note: this section, which touches on
complex legal territory, is, un-ironically, crafted by an AI. Food for
thought, right?

The domain of Intellectual Property (IP) and copyright concerning LLM-
generated content presents multifaceted challenges within the prevailing legal
and ethical frameworks. LLMs are trained on extensive datasets that may
frequently incorporate copyrighted materials. Consequently, outputs generated
by these models can exhibit substantial similarity to, or direct replication
of, pre-existing copyrighted works. This inherently introduces potential legal
liabilities for organisational entities and contributes to ambiguities
regarding ownership rights. While a comprehensive elucidation of this evolving
legal landscape is beyond the scope of this exposition, its significant
implications necessitate acute awareness. This concern underscores the
critical imperative for human oversight and rigorous review processes in the
development pipeline. For in-depth analysis and authoritative guidance on this
subject, consultation with legal professionals and specialised organisations
within the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property is
strongly recommended.

## TDD: The Methodology for Human-Driven Design Evolution and Deep Understanding

We've explored the very real pitfalls of relying on LLM-dumped code: the
opaque logic, hidden security issues, the maintenance trap, and that dangerous
erosion of true developer understanding. So, how do we counter this? How do we
leverage AI's speed without sacrificing the fundamental principles of robust
software engineering? For us, the answer lies squarely in **Test-Driven
Development (TDD)**. The efficacy of this integration is not merely
theoretical; its ability to improve LLM-generated code quality has been
**empirically demonstrated** by recent [research by Mathews &amp;
Nagappan(2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13521).

### TDD: Test-First, Design-Driving, Understanding-Building

While TDD is often mistakenly reduced to "just testing," its **original and
most profound purpose has always been to drive design**. In the LLM era, this
design-driving aspect becomes not just important, but absolutely essential.
It's the **methodology for actively fostering incremental design evolution and
building profound developer understanding** , a perspective increasingly
validated by contemporary research on LLM code generation ([Fakhoury et al.,
2024](<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382483913_LLM-based_Test->
driven_Interactive_Code_Generation_User_Study_and_Empirical_Evaluatio)).

{{< quote type="pull">}}
_"TDD helps you to pay attention to the right issues at the right time so you
can make your designs cleaner, you can refine your designs as you learn."_
{{< /quote >}}

— Kent Beck, [Test-Driven Development: By
Example](https://martinfowler.com/books/beckTDD.html)

{{< figure src="driving-ai-code-why-test-driven-development-8.png" alt="Driving AI Code: Why Test-Driven Development is Essential in the LLM Era" width=600 >}}

This is the human-led process, a tight cycle of **Red-Green-Refactor** , that
ensures design integrity and deepens comprehension even when AI assists with
code. This process is how you maintain control and build your own deep mental
model of the codebase.

* **Red (Write a failing test):** You write a small, executable test for something that doesn't exist yet. This isn't just about _testing_ behaviour; it's about **precisely defining a tiny piece of what you need**. When we say "unit," we mean a **testable behaviour or specific feature slice** , not necessarily a single function or class. This lets the tests drive the design, even if that behaviour spans multiple functions or classes. It forces you, the human, to think about the desired outcome, the inputs, and the outputs, even before writing any production code. This step is a **design exercise** in miniature.

* **Green (Write just enough code to pass the test):** You then write the minimal amount of production code needed to make that failing test pass. The goal here is strict functionality.

* **Refactor (Improve the code while keeping tests green):** Once the test passes, you clean up the code – improving its design, readability, and structure – with full confidence that your tests are guarding against regressions. This is where design truly emerges and solidifies.

This Red-Green-Refactor cycle becomes the **human-led process** that ensures
design integrity. It's the **clear framework** that guides LLMs' unpredictable
nature, forcing you to stay in control of how the software's design evolves.
Crucially, it helps you build your own deep mental model of the codebase, even
if an AI is helping with the coding details. It's not about letting AI do the
design; it's about making TDD the explicit architect of understanding.

### Countering the "Dump": TDD's Incremental Guidance for LLMs

The core problem with LLM-dumped code, as we discussed, is its monolithic
nature that skips human design. This is exactly where TDD steps in. TDD
doesn't just check LLM output; it fundamentally **changes how you interact**
with the AI to stop the "dump" from happening.

With TDD, you stay in control by being the **architect of incremental
design**. Instead of giving the LLM a huge prompt for a whole feature, you
break the problem down into its smallest, testable behaviours. Each Red step
in the TDD cycle becomes a precise, human-defined instruction for the LLM. You
write a small, failing test that defines _only_ the next piece of desired
behaviour.

This is where **prompt engineering** becomes super important. It's not about
crafting one huge prompt for everything. It's about:

  1. **Prompting for Tests:** You might ask the LLM to help draft the _failing test_ itself from a clear requirement, but ultimately, you decide if that test really captures the small behaviour you want.

  2. **Prompting for Minimal Code:** Once you have that small, failing test (the Red state), you then tell the LLM to generate _only the bare minimum production code needed to make that specific test pass_. This is key. We're explicitly telling the AI to _not_ generate anything more than what's needed for this current, narrow step.

{{< figure src="driving-ai-code-why-test-driven-development-9.png" alt="Driving AI Code: Why Test-Driven Development is Essential in the LLM Era" width=600 >}}

This iterative, test-driven prompting acts as a **firm leash** on the LLM's
otherwise unpredictable and "dumping" tendencies. It forces the AI to generate
code in small, easy-to-handle chunks, each directly tied to a human-understood
and human-verified requirement. This approach has been **empirically shown to
significantly improve the correctness and efficiency** of LLM-generated code
in recent academic [studies by Ahmed et al.
(2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13521). This way, the design isn't some
surprise in a massive dump; it **emerges bit by bit under human guidance**.
This makes sure that even when LLMs write the code, you stay firmly in control
of how the design evolves and why it's built that way.

### Understanding Through Iteration: Building the Developer's Mental Model (Not Just Validating)

Beyond just stopping monolithic code dumps and guiding LLM output, TDD does
something even bigger: it actively **builds your real understanding of the
codebase**. This isn't about just checking something someone else made; it's
about truly grasping the system as it grows.

When you, the human developer, go through the Red-Green-Refactor cycle, you're
constantly solving problems and clarifying design. Each "Red" step forces you
to precisely define a desired behaviour, its inputs, and what you expect back.
Writing a failing test _before_ any production code exists makes you think
deeply about the problem, how different parts of the system connect, and the
detailed logic needed. This hands-on involvement is totally different from
just reviewing a big chunk of pre-generated code. Even if an LLM helps with
the "Green" implementation, your mental picture of _why_ that test was
written, _what_ behaviour it represents, and _how_ it fits into the bigger
design is already forming.

{{< figure src="driving-ai-code-why-test-driven-development-10.png" alt="Driving AI Code: Why Test-Driven Development is Essential in the LLM Era" width=600 >}}

This iterative process – defining small behaviours, checking their
implementation, and then putting them together – steadily builds a detailed,
solid understanding of the code's architecture and logic in your mind. You own
the design, not just by saying "yes" to it, but by actively creating it
through tests. This level of understanding is super important for:

* **Effective Debugging:** When something breaks, you have a mental map of the system's design and what it's supposed to do. This lets you figure out problems faster, instead of just fumbling through opaque, AI-generated code.

* **Confident Refactoring:** Knowing _why_ each part of the code exists and _what_ it supports (because your tests guard it) empowers you to clean up and optimise without fear, even if an LLM wrote some of it initially.

* **Strategic Evolution:** With a deep understanding of the system's design, you can make smart choices about future features, scaling, and architectural changes, avoiding the traps of blindly adding to a system you don't really know.

Basically, TDD changes you from someone who just gets AI-generated code into
an active, understanding architect. It makes sure that even when LLMs handle
the coding details, **your comprehension of the design stays central and gets
stronger all the time.**

### TDD as the Safety Net for AI-Assisted Refactoring and Evolution

One of the unsung heroes of a good TDD practice, especially now with AI, is
its role as an amazing **safety net for refactoring and continuous code
evolution**. As we have talked about, LLM-generated code, without TDD's
guidance, can end up being opaque. Developers then hesitate to change it,
worried they'll break hidden parts or mess things up. TDD fixes this fear
directly.

When you have a full set of **human-guided, behaviour-driven tests** (built
step-by-step through Red-Green-Refactor), those tests become your ultimate
guardian. They're like executable rule books that constantly check if the
system is behaving as expected. This means you can confidently refactor the
underlying code, even if parts of it were initially generated by an LLM,
knowing your tests will immediately tell you if you accidentally broke
anything important.

This combination is powerful. While LLMs can sometimes suggest refactoring,
it's **your understanding of the design** (built through TDD) combined with
the **safety net of your tests** that lets you refactor with real confidence.
You can use the LLM for ideas on optimising or changing structures, but the
TDD test suite is the ultimate truth-teller. It ensures the code's core
behaviour stays intact. This lets developers actively make their codebases
better, instead of being paralysed by how complex or opaque un-understood,
LLM-dumped code might seem. It turns the codebase from a fragile problem into
a flexible asset, ready for constant improvement and adaptation.

## Final Thoughts

The ultimate goal of using AI in software development is **higher quality, not
just faster delivery**. TDD is the discipline that transforms LLMs into a
collaborative force ensuring quality.
