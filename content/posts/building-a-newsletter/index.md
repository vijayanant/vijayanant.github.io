I'm excited to announce that I'm starting a new newsletter! I've been thinking about this for a while, and I'm finally ready to take the plunge.

In this post, I want to take you behind the scenes and show you the process of creating the newsletter. I'll share the decisions I made along the way, and the 'why' behind those decisions.

## The Name: "Vijay Anant"

The first decision I had to make was what to name the newsletter. I considered a few different options, including:

* "The Pragmatic Engineer"
* "Build & Lead"
* "The High-Performing Team"

In the end, I decided to go with my own name: **"Vijay Anant"**.

{{< note type="log" title="Why I Chose My Name" >}}
I chose to use my own name for a few reasons:

* **It's personal and direct.** It feels like a letter from a friend, which is the kind of relationship I want to build with my readers.
* **It's authentic.** It's my real name, and it's the name I use everywhere else online.
* **It's flexible.** It doesn't tie me down to a specific topic. If I decide to change my focus in the future, I won't have to change the name of my newsletter.

## The Tagline: "Beyond 'It Works': A Deep Dive into Quality Software"

Once I had a name, I needed a tagline. The tagline is important because it tells people what the newsletter is about. I wanted a tagline that was both descriptive and intriguing.

After a bit of brainstorming, I landed on:

**"Beyond 'It Works': A Deep Dive into Quality Software"**

{{< note type="info" title="The Meaning Behind the Tagline" >}}
This tagline captures the essence of my writing. I'm not just interested in code that "works." I'm interested in code that is well-designed, well-tested, and easy to maintain. I'm interested in the craft of quality software.

## The Description

Here's the full description for the newsletter:

> Go beyond the surface-level discussions of what "works" and take a deep dive into the craft of quality software. This newsletter explores the principles, patterns, and practices that lead to code that is not just functional, but also well-designed, maintainable, and a pleasure to work with. Expect practical advice, in-depth analysis, and a relentless focus on technical excellence.

## The Platform: Buttondown

I've decided to use [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) as the platform for my newsletter. It's a simple, elegant, and developer-friendly platform that's perfect for my needs.

* Choosing a name is a big decision. Don't be afraid to use your own name.
* A good tagline is descriptive and intriguing.
* A welcome email is a great way to set expectations and to connect with your new subscribers.
