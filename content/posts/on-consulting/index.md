{{< summary title="" >}}
I was always fascinated by consulting work; the flexibility on schedule was
appealing. The possibility of free time/downtime between contracts was all too
alluring even if it meant smaller pay check. I even made plans as to how I
will use that downtime to make up for things that I wouldn’t have time in a
full-time role.

The unexpected advantage, as it turned out to be, was that it accelerated
certain type of learning. I ended up working with many startups that has given
me skillset and perspective I never had previously. I learned which of my
skills apply when and where. Some deep rooted beliefs about which of my skills
are important and should focus on are shattered.

I am **not** going to write about how to get your first client, what are your
‘business overheads’, or even what skills are valued. There is plenty written
about that already. What I am going to write about are my personal experiences
and learnings. I will try to make them as useful as possible for others by
generalising them. I also don’t want to tag them as good or bad, but these are
some of my experiences in the wild.

### **Learning**

My transition into consulting introduced a new dimension to my learning.
Unlike my previous roles, where learning was deep and focused, consulting
presented me with a broader spectrum of knowledge. While the depth of learning
might not have been as profound as before, the breadth of exposure to many
technologies, business models, and industries was huge.

The nature of engagements often necessitated gaining knowledge quickly and
adapting to new environments. This fast-paced learning environment forced me
to quickly grasp the core concepts and apply them effectively. The variety of
problems I saw and the adapted solutions that were in place added to my
skillset and broadened my perspective.

If you are impressed by this, I suggest a balance between breadth-first and
in-depth learning is essential for continuous professional development.
Strategically alternating between these two approaches is beneficial in the
long run.

### Feeling Alienated

Consultants are often seen as outsiders. You are temporary person in the team.
You are not part of the company's culture or social fabric, and you may not
have the same level of rapport with colleagues as full-time employees. This
can make it difficult for you to feel like you belong or are truly integrated
into the team.

This is not to say you don’t have work relationships as a consultant. Of
course, the extent to which you feel alienated will vary depending on
individual circumstances and the specific company culture. The work
relationships that you form tend to be different from those of full-time
employees. While you may have a broader network of contacts, your interactions
with individual colleagues tend to be less deep and sustained. This is due to
the transient nature of consulting engagements, which often last for a few
months or even weeks.

### Office Dynamics

Consulting often insulates one from office dynamics. It can be easier for you
to bring up hard topics. You are often hired specifically for your ability to
provide impartial assessments and recommendations, free from the biases and
allegiances that can cloud the judgment of internal employees.

This insulation can be particularly valuable when addressing sensitive or
challenging topics, as you are often perceived as objective third party with
no vested interest in the outcome. This often puts you in a unique position
where you alone can solve a particular problem that your client is facing.
This boosts your credibility and influence among clients. This can lead to
more consulting opportunities and higher fees.

### Sense of Ownership

While you may have the opportunity to make a significant impact on the
clients' businesses, you often don't have the same sense of ownership or
permanence as employees do. This can be frustrating for some of you, who may
prefer to build something from the ground up and see it grow over time.

### Always Firefighting

You often end up in situations that are intense and challenging due to the
pressure to make impactful changes within a short timeframe. You often step
into situations with urgent problems or critical gaps, requiring you to
quickly assess the situation, prioritise tasks, and take decisive action. You
face high expectations from stakeholders, need to adapt to unfamiliar
environments, and may have limited resources and support. This is very
exhausting.

Despite the challenges, this is very rewarding too and can offer valuable
learning experiences. This helps you gain a deep understanding of different
industries and develop new skills.

This can also be a source of bragging points. Those who can successfully
navigate these challenges and deliver results under pressure are highly
valued. You can build a reputation for being problem solver which can lead to
more opportunities and higher fees.

This is not intended to be a guide to consulting, but rather a window into my
own personal experiences. By sharing my observations, I hope to offer a
glimpse into the various facets of consulting, both the exhilarating highs and
the inevitable challenges.
