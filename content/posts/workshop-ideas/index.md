### **Cloud Architecture &amp; Scalability**

  1. **Scaling Without Regret: Patterns and Anti-Patterns**

 _Hands-on: take a small monolithic app and scale it with horizontal replicas,
load balancers, and caching strategies, observing pitfalls._

  2. **Serverless Done Right**

 _Hands-on: build a serverless app with real production considerations: cold
starts, retries, monitoring._

### **Engineering Practices / Dev Discipline**

  1. **Feature Flags, Rollouts &amp; Safe Deployments  
** _Hands-on: implement canary releases, A/B testing, and rollbacks with
sample apps._

  2. **Observability on a Budget**

 _Hands-on: instrument a multi-service app with logging, metrics, and
distributed tracing._

### **Day-to-Day Engineering Workshops**

  1. **Refactoring Legacy Systems Without Breaking Everything  
** _Hands-on: small codebases with technical debt, teach safe refactoring
techniques._

  2. **Building Observability &amp; Monitoring from Scratch  
** _Hands-on: set up metrics, logs, and alerts for a sample multi-service
application._
