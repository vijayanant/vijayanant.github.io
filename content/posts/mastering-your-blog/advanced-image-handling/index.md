In previous posts, we've explored enhancing our blog with various shortcodes. Now, let's tackle one of the most critical aspects of a modern website: images. While standard Markdown is great for simplicity, it falls short when it comes to performance and control. In this post, we'll introduce a powerful custom `figure` shortcode to create beautiful, fast-loading, and responsive images.

### The Problem with Standard Images

When you use the standard Markdown syntax `![alt](image.jpg)`, you get a simple `<img>` tag. This has several drawbacks:

- **No Size Control:** The image is rendered at its original size, which can break your layout or be unnecessarily large.
- **No Optimization:** You can't serve smaller images to smaller devices, leading to slow load times on mobile.
- **Legacy Formats:** You're stuck with formats like JPEG or PNG, even when modern browsers support more efficient formats like WebP.

### A Better Way: The `figure` Shortcode

To solve these issues, we've introduced a new `figure` shortcode. It's a drop-in replacement for your image tags that unlocks a host of modern features.

The code for this shortcode is located in `layouts/shortcodes/figure.html`. We created it in a previous step.

### How to Use It

Hereâ€™s how you can use the new shortcode in your posts. Note that for this to work, your images must be stored in the same folder as your `index.md` file.

```html
{{</* figure 
    src="featured.jpg" 
    alt="A descriptive alt text for the image" 
    caption="This is an optional caption that appears below the image." 
    width="600" 
*/>}}
```

This simple piece of code generates a complex block of HTML that is highly optimized for any browser or device.

### Feature Breakdown

Let's look at what this shortcode does for you automatically:

1. **Responsive Images (`srcset`)**: It generates multiple sizes of your image (small, medium, large). The browser then automatically downloads the most appropriate size based on the user's screen, saving bandwidth and speeding up load times.
2. **Next-Gen WebP Format**: It creates a WebP version of your image, which is much smaller than a traditional JPEG. It serves this to compatible browsers while keeping the original JPEG as a fallback for older ones.
3. **Lazy Loading**: The `loading="lazy"` attribute tells the browser to only load the image when it's about to enter the screen, which dramatically improves initial page load speed.
4. **Full Control**: You can specify a `width`, `alt` text, and an optional `caption`, giving you full semantic and stylistic control over your images.

{{< summary title="Key Takeaways" >}}

- Standard Markdown for images is not optimal for performance.
- Use the new `figure` shortcode for responsive, fast-loading images.
- Place images in the same folder as your `index.md` to use the shortcode.
- Enjoy the benefits of `srcset`, WebP, and lazy loading automatically!

By using this shortcode, you not only make your pages load faster but also provide a better user experience, which is a win-win for you and your readers.
