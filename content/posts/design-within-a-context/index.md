Words have multiple meanings. Oftentimes with opposite connotations. We use
same words and phrases to mean different things. Consider the following
sentences:

  * Kashi, Hrishikesh, and many other holy cities are situated on the banks of river Ganga.

  * Detectives examined the syringe for DNA traces and deposited the information in a central data bank.

  * The rating agency questioned the babk’s ability to raise enough capital.

We humans can quickly understand the different usages of the word ‘bank’; but
for computers it is not so easy. How do humans know which meaning to apply in
each of those cases? Where does that additional information come from to help
us pick the correct meaning?

The rest of the sentences of course. We call that the ‘context’. The rest of
the sentences tell us the context in which the word is bing used. Without this
knowledge, the reader (or listener) may misunderstand what is being said.
