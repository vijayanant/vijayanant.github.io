# Hugo Blog: Vision and Requirements Document (v2)

## 1. Vision & Core Principles

### 1.1. Project Vision

To create a self-hosted Hugo site that is more than just a chronological series of posts, but a structured, interconnected **knowledge base** for software architects.

### 1.2. Core Design Principles

*   **Clarity of Navigation:** A reader should always understand where they are and know where to go next.
*   **Simplicity:** The content model should be simple and intuitive for both authors and readers.
*   **Scalability:** The site architecture must support a growing library of content without becoming cluttered.
*   **Excellent Reader Experience:** The site must be fast, accessible, responsive, and a pleasure to read.

## 2. Core Functional Requirements (MVP)

This is the simplified core feature set for the first version of the site.

**FR1: Unified Content Model**
*   **Description:** The site will have one single content type: `posts`. All articles, whether standalone or part of a series, will be a `post`.
*   **Rationale:** This simplifies the authoring experience and site structure.

**FR2: Series Functionality**
*   **Description:** A `post` can be made part of a `series` by adding `series` and `series_order` to its front matter.
*   **Rationale:** This is the primary mechanism for creating structured, guided learning paths, which is a core goal of the knowledge base.

**FR3: Unified Post Layout**
*   **Description:** A single layout will be used for all posts. This layout will feature:
    1.  A sticky, auto-generating Table of Contents sidebar for easy navigation within any article.
    2.  A conditional "Series Navigation" block that appears if the post is part of a series.
*   **Rationale:** This provides a consistent, high-quality reading experience for all content.

**FR4: Series Hub Page**
*   **Description:** The `series` field will be a formal taxonomy, which will cause Hugo to automatically generate a hub page at `/series/` that lists all available series.
*   **Rationale:** This provides a crucial entry point for readers to discover and engage with long-form, structured content.

### 3.2. Content & Reading Experience

*   **Image Lightbox:** Allows readers to click a diagram or image to view it full-screen.
*   **Related Posts:** Automatically display a list of related articles at the end of each post.
*   **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** A UI toggle to switch between light and dark color schemes.
*   **Dynamic Social Sharing Cards:** Automatically generate custom, branded images for links shared on social media.

### 3.3. Community & Engagement

### 3.4. Authoring & Performance
