# The Explorer's Log: Strategy & Roadmap

This document defines the strategy for the newsletter/blog. The goal is to build authority in the distributed systems space without revealing the internal design of the Sovereign platform.

## 1. The Persona: The Curiosity-Driven Explorer
We do not write as "Founders pitching a product." We write as **Researchers documenting a journey.**
*   **Tone:** Inquisitive, technical but accessible, slightly skeptical of "The Cloud."
*   **Goal:** To understand how others have solved these problems and evaluate the best path forward.

## 2. Stealth-Safe Rules (The IP Shield)
To protect Sovereign's unique architecture, every post must follow these constraints:
1.  **Principles over Implementation:** Talk about *why* a concept matters, not *how* we specifically coded it.
2.  **The "History Lesson" Shield:** Use existing protocols (Git, BitTorrent, Signal, IPFS) as the primary examples.
3.  **The "Exploring X" Frame:** Always frame the post as an investigation into existing technology "X" rather than a reveal of our own solution.
4.  **No "Universal Graph" Mention:** Do not discuss the specific orchestration of nodes and edges that makes Sovereign unique.

## 3. The Topic Master List

| ID | Topic | Working Title | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 001 | Content Addressing | Exploring Content Addressing: The Anatomy of a Permanent Web | Done |
| 002 | Cryptographic Identity | Exploring Identity: Why PGP Failed and What Comes Next | Done |
| 003 | Privacy (Encryption) | Exploring Privacy: The Sealed Vault (Encryption at Rest) | Published |
| 004 | Access Control (Sharing) | Exploring Sharing: The Cryptographic Handshake | Planned |
| 005 | The Sync Problem | Exploring the Sync Problem: How do we agree on "Now"? | Planned |

| 007 | Dumb Servers | Exploring Zero-Knowledge: The beauty of dumb relays | Planned |
| 008 | Streaming Data | Exploring gRPC: The death of the Round-Trip | Planned |

## 4. Writing Workflow
1.  **Research Phase:** Collect 3-5 external references/papers for the topic.
2.  **Outline Phase:** Define the "Aha!" moment for the reader.
3.  **Drafting Phase:** Write the content in `.md` format in this directory.
4.  **Review:** Ensure no "Sovereign-isms" leaked into the text.
