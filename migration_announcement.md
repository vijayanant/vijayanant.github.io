Subject: A Quick Heads-Up: My Newsletter Has a New Home

Hey everyone,

Some news: I'm moving my newsletter off of Substack and onto my own custom-built site at **[Your New Website URL, e.g., vijayanant.com]**.

### Why the move?

Honestly, I just wanted more control over the reading experience and a single place to put all my writing. This move lets me do that.

### What this means for you:

*   **New Email:** My posts will now come from **[Your New Email Address]**.
*   **New Site:** Everything now lives at **[Your New Website URL]**.
*   **Your Subscription:** You're all set. I've already moved the subscriber list over, so you don't have to do a thing.

### One quick favor:

To make sure my emails don't get lost in a spam folder, please add **[Your New Email Address]** to your contacts.

### A heads-up about the old site:

This Substack will stick around for a little while, but all new writing will be on the new site. I'd update your bookmarks when you get a chance.

### To kick things off, a new series is already live!

I just dropped a full, 7-part series called **Architecture: From Patterns to Practice**.

It's a step-by-step look at how an architect makes real-world decisions when stuck between building for speed and building for scale. No fluff, just a practical framework.

You can read the whole thing right now:

**[Check out the "From Patterns to Practice" series here]({{< ref "/series/from-patterns-to-practice" >}})**

Thanks for coming along on this. I'm excited about what's next and appreciate you being here.

Cheers,

Vijay
