title: "Software Architecture: From Patterns to Practice"
description: "A foundational workshop for software engineers who want to learn the principles of software architecture and how to apply them in practice."
overview: "Are you a software engineer ready to move beyond just writing code and start designing systems? This workshop is for tech leads, aspiring architects, and developers who want to build a solid foundation in software architecture. We'll go beyond the theory of architectural patterns and provide a repeatable, data-driven framework for making and justifying key design decisions. You'll leave with the practical skills to design systems that are scalable, resilient, and aligned with core business goals."
key_takeaways:
  - "Understand the role of the software architect and the key responsibilities of the role."
  - "Learn how to use a data-driven framework, like the Weighted Scoring Matrix, to evaluate and select the best architectural pattern for a given business problem."
  - "Gain practical skills in designing for scalability, resilience, and maintainability."
  - "Discover how to document architectural decisions using Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to improve communication and team alignment."
  - "Develop a repeatable process for making sound architectural decisions that you can apply immediately in your work."
syllabus:
  - title: "The Architect's Mindset"
    description: "Explore the core concepts of software architecture, including the role of the architect, the importance of quality attributes, and how to transform vague requirements into measurable scenarios."
  - title: "Architectural Styles and Patterns"
    description: "Take a deep-dive into common architectural styles like Microservices, Monoliths, and Event-Driven systems, focusing on their real-world trade-offs and how they impact quality attributes."
  - title: "The Decision-Making Engine"
    description: "Master the Weighted Scoring Matrix, a powerful and objective tool for evaluating and selecting the right architecture for your needs through a series of hands-on exercises."
  - title: "Communicating Architecture"
    description: "Learn how to document your decisions with Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and effectively communicate your designs to your team and stakeholders."
  - title: "The Architect's Toolkit & Real-world Challenges"
    description: "Explore additional tools like Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Threat Modeling, and discuss the human and organizational challenges of design in real-world scenarios."
target_audience:
  - "You're a mid-level to senior software engineer who wants to learn more about software architecture."
  - "You're a tech lead who wants to provide your team with a solid foundation in software architecture."
  - "You're an engineering manager who wants to improve the architectural skills of your team."
format: "This is a full-day, interactive workshop that can be delivered remotely or in-person. The workshop includes a mix of presentations, group discussions, and hands-on exercises."
